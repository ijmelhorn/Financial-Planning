CU Financial Planning, APIs, Monte Carlo Simulation


Created a personal finance planner that allows credit union membersto visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund. Also created a retirement planning tool that uses the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then ran Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance up to 30 years.
